Assessment 2: Entrepreneur Interview Analysis [30%] 
Unit   Learning Outcomes:
Critically analyze the attributes and   achievements   of an   entrepreneur (ULO2);
Analyze how entrepreneurs recognize opportunities, how they   network   and   how   they create wealth within the   real   world (ULO3).
Explain   how entrepreneurs sustain   business   growth (ULO4).
Introduction 
The   purpose of   this assessment   is to develop your   critical   and   analytical   skills   in   relation to the study of entrepreneurship-in-action. As your exposure to   key
concepts and   ideas   in the field of entrepreneurship studies   increases,   making sense of   the (sometimes competing) theories,   methods and   practices   becomes      harder. This task is designed to get you to think about   how the   lived experience   of being an entrepreneur   can   be   understood through the vast   literature. There are two   parts to the assignment as described   below.
Assignment Task 
Thisassignmenttaskhas two distinctphases: 
Phase 1: Conduct   an   interview   with   an   entrepreneur.Working   in small   groups (of 2-3   people) assigned to you   by your tutor   in-class,   your task is to interview an entrepreneur who is   (preferably)   currently   running   a   business to   understand their   journey to-date in venture creation.
You   may   not select a   neighborhood   local   business such as   single-owner operated deli’s,   restaurants, grocery store or   café   .   If   you   select   a   retail entrepreneur, you   must   interview one who   has a chain   of stores   (at   least   more   than two). A franchisee (e.g., takeaway food,   lawn services,   printing shops   are often franchisee operations) is   not an appropriate choice for   interview   as they   are   not the original   owner, and the   business   model   is   rarely a   deviation from the parent company’s   intentions. Some   points to   note:
•          You may   need 1-11/2   hours for the   interview – using the questions from
page   64 of the   unit textbook (Frederick, et al,   2019)   as   a   guide. A downloadable   pdf of   the questions is available on the   Blackboard   site (under Assessment 2   tab). Try and   limit your   questions to   about   10.   Beyond   that, the   interview will   get too   long. 
•          Send an email   of   the questions to the   entrepreneur well   before the   interview so that they   have enough time to   prepare.
•          It   is also a good   idea   to   ask   them   more   open-ended   questions   at   the beginning or end of   the interview to   build   so代 写MGMT3004 (Entrepreneurship) Assessment 2 Brief Semester 1 2024R

•         You   need to   record the   interview with your smartphone so that you can   transcribe the   interview to   be attached to the final   report.
•         When interviewing, always be on the   lookout for the ‘magic’   30 seconds –   the things   people say   in the final   moments of   your encounter with them. There are often comments that   people   make as they   show you the   door that   reveal   some interesting insights into their   persona, thinking   or values -   keep the   recording   running   until   then!
Phase 2: Analyze   and   create a timeline (using   PowerPoint).
Working from the single   interview you   have   made as a   group; you will   continue to   work as a group to   analyze the   interview. You   need to   create   a timeline   of   the entrepreneur’s   journey. This analysis should consider the chronological sequence of events that tell   the story of   the entrepreneur   in   relation to the   ideas,   concepts, theories, and   practices that we   have explored   in-class and   online. 
Like Assessment 1, you   have   been given a template to   use for the   assignment.   Some   points to   note:
-          You   need to first   create   a timeline   as   described   above   using   PowerPoint. A   zip file of some sample timeline templates   is available for download   on the Blackboard site. You can   pick   up any template from this   or   use your   own.   The   choice   is yours.   Make sure you change the template to suit this   assignment. 
-          You   can   use   only   2   slides to   represent your timeline.
-          Just to   remind you once   more –   you   are   creating   the   timeline   of   the
entrepreneurial journey, connected to the concepts we explore in-class.   So,   make sure that the concepts taught in   class   are   linked to the   entrepreneur’s   journey.
-          A template for the   assignment   submission   (word format)   is   available   for
download.   Download this template and follow the   instructions on   it to finalize your assignment (you   need to copy and   paste the   PowerPoint   slides   from your   timeline on to this template). You only   need to submit this   document for your            assignment submission (on Turnitin).   You will   need to add   your   references   on         to this document, along with a   copy   of   the   interview transcript.
-          Only   one   person   needs to   submit the   final   version.   Please   make   sure   that   the   title   page   has the   names and student   IDs of all   group   members.
